        "1.  What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods). It is a way of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Think of it like a cookie cutter: the cookie cutter is the class, and the cookies you make from it are the objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), an object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that has the properties and behaviors defined by its class. Following the cookie cutter analogy, if the class is the cookie cutter, an object is the actual cookie.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "=>\n",
        " Abstraction and encapsulation are two key concepts in Object-Oriented Programming, and while they are related, they serve different purposes.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object. It's about dealing with the \"what\" rather than the \"how\". Think of using a TV remote: you only need to know which button to press to change the channel or adjust the volume, not the intricate electronic processes happening inside the TV and the remote. Abstraction simplifies the view of complex systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Encapsulation, on the other hand, is about bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, which is a class. It also involves controlling access to the data, preventing direct modification from outside the class. This protects the data from accidental or unauthorized changes. Think of a capsule containing medication: the medicine is enclosed within the capsule, and you can only access it by taking the capsule as a whole. Encapsulation helps in organizing code and protecting data integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Dunder methods, also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that have double underscores at the beginning and end of their names (e.g., __init__, __str__, __add__). They are not meant to be invoked directly by the programmer but are called internally by Python in specific situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "These methods allow you to define how objects of your class behave with built-in operations and functions. For example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- __init__: This is the constructor method, called when you create a new instance of a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "- __str__: This method defines the string representation of an object, used by the str() function and print().\n",
        "\n",
        "- __add__: This method defines the behavior of the addition operator (+) for objects of your class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dunder methods enable Python's object-oriented features and allow you to make your custom objects work seamlessly with Python's standard library and syntax.\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class (called the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from another class (called the superclass or base class).\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like real-world inheritance. A child inherits traits from their parents. In OOP, a subclass inherits the characteristics of its superclass. This means the subclass can use the methods and attributes defined in the superclass without having to redefine them.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Polymorphism is another key concept in Object-Oriented Programming that means \"many forms\". In OOP, it refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own unique ways.\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine you have a superclass called Shape with a method called calculate_area(). You could then have subclasses like Circle, Square, and Triangle that inherit from Shape. Each of these subclasses would have its own implementation of the calculate_area() method, because the formula for calculating the area is different for each shape.\n",
        "\n",
        "With polymorphism, you can write code that works with a collection of Shape objects (e.g., a list containing a Circle, a Square, and a Triangle) and call the calculate_area() method on each object without needing to know the specific type of shape. The correct calculate_area() method for each object will be executed automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "This allows for more flexible and reusable code. You can write generic code that operates on objects of a superclass, and that code will work correctly with any subclass that implements the necessary methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Encapsulation in Python is achieved primarily through the use of classes. By defining attributes (data) and methods (functions) within a class, you bundle them together into a single unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Python doesn't have strict access modifiers like public, private, or protected in the same way that some other object-oriented languages do (like Java or C++), it uses conventions and name mangling to provide a level of data protection and control over access:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Public attributes and methods: By default, all attributes and methods defined in a class are public. This means they can be accessed and modified directly from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Protected attributes and methods (convention): By convention, attributes and methods that are intended for internal use within the class or its subclasses are prefixed with a single underscore (e.g., _internal_variable). This is a hint to other developers that these members should not be accessed directly from outside the class, although it doesn't technically prevent access.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Private attributes and methods (name mangling): To provide a stronger form of encapsulation, you can prefix an attribute or method with double underscores (e.g., __private_variable). When the Python interpreter encounters these names within a class definition, it performs \"name mangling.\" This means it changes the name internally to include the class name (e.g., _ClassName__private_variable). This makes it harder (though not impossible) to access these members directly from outside the class, as you would need to know the mangled name. This is often used to avoid naming conflicts in inheritance scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects of a class. It is automatically called when you create a new instance of a class. The primary purpose of a constructor is to set up the initial state of the object by assigning values to its attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, the constructor method is always named __init__ (with double underscores before and after).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example-\n",
        "\n",
        "    class MyClass:\n",
        "        def __init__(self, value):\n",
        "        self.my_attribute = value\n",
        "        print(\"Object created and initialized!\")\n",
        "    obj = MyClass(10) # Creating an object of MyClass\n",
        "    print(obj.my_attribute) # Accessing the attribute initialized by the constructor\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this example:\n",
        "\n",
        "- The __init__ method is defined within the MyClass.\n",
        "- It takes self as the first argument (which refers to the instance of the class being created) and another argument value.\n",
        "- Inside __init__, self.my_attribute = value assigns the value passed during object creation to an attribute named my_attribute for that specific object.\n",
        "- When obj = MyClass(10) is executed, the __init__ method is automatically called, and the value 10 is passed to the value parameter.\n",
        "\n",
        "Constructors are essential for ensuring that objects are created in a valid state with all necessary initial data.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> In Python, class methods and static methods are types of methods that are defined within a class but behave differently from regular instance methods. They are distinguished by the decorators @classmethod and @staticmethod respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Class Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Decorator: @classmethod\n",
        "- First Argument: The first argument of a class method is conventionally named cls, which refers to the class itself (not the instance).\n",
        "- Purpose: Class methods are primarily used to define methods that operate on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance. They can be used to create factory methods (alternative ways to create instances of the class) or to access or modify class-level attributes.\n",
        "- Can Access: They can access and modify class attributes using the cls argument. They cannot directly access instance attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example -\n",
        "\n",
        "    class MyClass:\n",
        "       class_variable = \"I am a class variable\"\n",
        "\n",
        "       @classmethod\n",
        "       def class_method(cls):\n",
        "          print(f\"This is a class method.\")\n",
        "          print(f\"Accessing class variable: {cls.class_variable}\")\n",
        "    MyClass.class_method()\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Static Methods:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Decorator: @staticmethod\n",
        "- First Argument: Static methods do not take a special first argument like self (for instance methods) or cls (for class methods). They behave like regular functions but are defined within a class's namespace.\n",
        "- Purpose: Static methods are used for utility functions that are logically related to the class but do not need access to either the instance or the class itself. They are essentially functions grouped within a class for organizational purposes.\n",
        "- Can Access: They cannot access instance attributes or class attributes directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example -\n",
        "\n",
        "    class MyClass:\n",
        "       @staticmethod\n",
        "       def static_method(x, y):\n",
        "           print(f\"This is a static method.\")\n",
        "           return x + y\n",
        "    print(MyClass.static_method(5, 3))\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Method overloading is a concept in some programming languages where you can have multiple methods in the same class with the same name but different parameters (different number of arguments or different types of arguments). The correct method to be executed is determined at compile time based on the arguments provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, Python does not support method overloading in the traditional sense like languages such as Java or C++. If you define multiple methods with the same name in a Python class, the last one defined will override the previous ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "example-\n",
        "\n",
        "    class MyClass:\n",
        "       def greet(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Hello!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    def greet(self, name):\n",
        "        print(f\"Hello, {name}!\")\n",
        "    \n",
        "    obj = MyClass() # Creating an instance\n",
        "    obj.greet(\"Alice\") # This will work, calling the second greet method\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "=>\n",
        "Method overriding is a key concept in Object-Oriented Programming where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- You have a superclass with a method.\n",
        "- You have a subclass that inherits from the superclass.\n",
        "- In the subclass, you define a method with the exact same name and signature (number and type of parameters) as a method in the superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you call this method on an object of the subclass, the version of the method defined in the subclass will be executed, rather than the one in the superclass. This allows subclasses to provide their own specialized behavior for methods inherited from their parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why is it used?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Specialized Behavior: Subclasses can tailor the behavior of an inherited method to their specific needs.\n",
        "- Polymorphism: Method overriding is essential for achieving polymorphism. It allows objects of different classes (subclasses of a common superclass) to respond to the same method call in ways that are appropriate for their type.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Animal:\n",
        "        def speak(self):\n",
        "           print(\"Generic animal sound\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Dog(Animal):\n",
        "       def speak(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Woof!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Cat(Animal):\n",
        "      def speak(self):\n",
        "          print(\"Meow!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    generic_animal = Animal() # Create objects\n",
        "    dog = Dog()\n",
        "    cat = Cat()\n",
        "\n",
        "    generic_animal.speak()  # Output: Generic animal sound\n",
        "    dog.speak()             # Output: Woof!\n",
        "    cat.speak()             # Output: Meow!\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> The property decorator in Python is a built-in decorator that provides a convenient way to define methods that can be accessed like attributes. It allows you to get, set, or delete an attribute's value using methods, without changing the way you access that attribute from outside the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Essentially, it turns a method into a \"getter\" for an attribute. You can then define \"setter\" and \"deleter\" methods for the same attribute using <property_name>.setter and <property_name>.deleter decorators, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's why and when you might use the @property decorator:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Controlled Access to Attributes: It allows you to add logic when getting or setting an attribute's value. For example, you can perform validation on the value being set, or compute the value dynamically when it's accessed.\n",
        "- Backward Compatibility: If you initially implemented a class with a public attribute and later need to add some logic around accessing or modifying that attribute, you can use @property to convert the attribute access into method calls without changing the external interface of the class. This means code that was using the attribute directly will continue to work.\n",
        "- Read-Only Attributes: You can define a @property with only a getter method to create a read-only attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's an example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class Circle:\n",
        "         def __init__(self, radius):\n",
        "              self._radius = radius  # Use a convention to indicate it's intended for internal use\n",
        "\n",

        "        print(\"Setting radius\")\n",
        "        if value >= 0:\n",
        "            self._radius = value\n",
        "        else:\n",
        "            raise ValueError(\"Radius cannot be negative\")\n",
        "\n",
        "    @radius.deleter\n",

        "    print(c.radius)\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> Polymorphism is important in Object-Oriented Programming for several key reasons:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Code Reusability: Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of different types (as long as they share a common superclass or interface) in a uniform way. You can write a single function or method that takes an object of the superclass type and call a method on it, and the correct version of that method (defined in the subclass) will be executed. This reduces code duplication.\n",
        "2. Flexibility and Extensibility: With polymorphism, you can easily add new subclasses without having to modify the existing code that uses the superclass. As long as the new subclasses implement the necessary methods, the existing code will work correctly with the new types of objects. This makes your code more flexible and easier to extend.\n",
        "3. Simplified Code: Polymorphism simplifies code by allowing you to treat objects of different types in the same way. You don't need to write separate conditional statements (if-elif-else) or switch cases to handle each specific type. This leads to cleaner, more concise, and easier-to-understand code.\n",
        "4. Improved Maintainability: Because polymorphism promotes code reusability and reduces the need for type-specific logic, it makes your code easier to maintain. If you need to change the behavior of a specific type, you only need to modify the implementation of the method in that subclass, without affecting the code that uses the superclass.\n",
        "5. Decoupling: Polymorphism helps to decouple the code that uses objects from the specific implementation details of those objects. The code interacts with objects based on their shared interface (defined in the superclass), rather than their concrete types. This reduces dependencies and makes the code more modular.\n",
        "\n",
        "--\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (you cannot create objects directly from it). It is designed to be a blueprint for other classes (subclasses). Abstract classes often contain one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared in the abstract class but have no implementation. Subclasses that inherit from an abstract class are required to provide implementations for all of its abstract methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstract classes are used to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Define a common interface: They establish a set of methods that all concrete subclasses must implement, ensuring a consistent structure.\n",
        "2. Enforce implementation: They force subclasses to provide their own specific implementations for abstract methods, promoting polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Python, you can create abstract classes using the abc module (Abstract Base Classes). Here's how:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Import ABC and abstractmethod from the abc module.\n",

        "\n",
        "=> Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) offers several significant advantages that contribute to building robust, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Here are some of the key benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Modularity: OOP promotes breaking down complex problems into smaller, self-contained objects. Each object is responsible for a specific part of the system, making the code easier to understand, develop, and debug.\n",
        "- Reusability: Through concepts like inheritance, you can reuse existing classes and their functionalities in new classes. This saves development time and effort by avoiding redundant code.\n",
        "- Maintainability: The modular nature of OOP makes code easier to maintain. When you need to modify or fix something, you can often do so within a specific object or class without affecting other parts of the system.\n",
        "- Extensibility: OOP makes it easier to extend the functionality of a system. You can add new classes or modify existing ones with minimal impact on the rest of the code, thanks to concepts like inheritance and polymorphism.\n",
        "- Flexibility: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably, as long as they share a common interface. This provides flexibility in designing and implementing solutions.\n",
        "- Abstraction: OOP allows you to hide complex implementation details behind a simple interface. This simplifies the view of objects and makes them easier to use.\n",
        "- Improved Collaboration: The clear structure and modularity of OOP make it easier for multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously, as they can focus on different objects or classes independently.\n",
        "- Reduced Complexity: By organizing code into objects and classes, OOP helps manage complexity in large software projects. It provides a structured approach to design and development.\n",

        "1. Class Variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "-Definition: Class variables are defined directly within the class but outside of any methods.\n",
        "-Scope: They are shared among all instances (objects) of a class. There is only one copy of the class variable, and all objects of that class access the same copy.\n",
        "- Access: They can be accessed using either the class name (ClassName.class_variable) or an instance of the class (instance_name.class_variable). However, it's generally recommended to access or modify class variables using the class name to make it clear that you are working with the class-level attribute.\n",
        "- Use Case: Class variables are often used to store data that is common to all instances of a class, such as constants, counters, or default values.\n",

        "- Definition: Instance variables are defined within the methods of a class, typically within the __init__ constructor using the self keyword (self.instance_variable).\n",
        "- Scope: They are unique to each instance (object) of a class. Each object has its own copy of the instance variables.\n",
        "- Access: They are accessed using an instance of the class (instance_name.instance_variable).\n",

        "\n",
        "=> Multiple inheritance is a feature in some object-oriented programming languages, including Python, where a class can inherit properties and behaviors from more than one parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, a subclass can be derived from multiple superclasses. This allows the subclass to combine features from all of its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "      +-------+   +-------+\n",

        "How Python handles Multiple Inheritance (Method Resolution Order - MRO):\n",
        "\n",
        "When you use multiple inheritance and a method is called on an object of the subclass, Python needs a way to determine which parent class's method to execute if the method exists in multiple parent classes. This is handled by the Method Resolution Order (MRO).\n",
        "\n",
        "Python uses the C3 linearization algorithm to determine the MRO. You can see the MRO of a class using the .__mro__ attribute or the help() function.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    class A:\n",
        "    def greet(self):\n",

        "    print(D.__mro__)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of ClassC(A, B), Python will look for the greet method first in C, then in A, and then in B. So, obj_c.greet() will call the greet method from ClassA.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of ClassD(B, A), Python will look for the greet method first in D, then in B, and then in A. So, obj_d.greet() will call the greet method from ClassB.\n",

        "\n",
        "=>\n",
        "1. __str__(self):\n",
        "Purpose: This method is used to define the \"informal\" or \"nicely printable\" string representation of an object. It's intended to be human-readable.\n",
        "Called by: The str() built-in function and the print() function.\n",
        "When to use: Use __str__ when you want to provide a user-friendly string representation of your object.\n",
        "Default Behavior: If you don't define __str__, Python will use the __repr__ method as a fallback if it's defined. If neither is defined, it will provide a default representation that is often not very informative (e.g., <__main__.MyClass object at 0x...>).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. __repr__(self):\n",
        "Purpose: This method is used to define the \"official\" or \"developer-friendly\" string representation of an object. It's intended to be unambiguous and, if possible, should be a string that could be used to recreate the object.\n",
        "Called by: The repr() built-in function, interactive Python sessions (when you just type the object's name), and as a fallback for str() and print() if __str__ is not defined.\n",
        "When to use: Use __repr__ when you want to provide a detailed and unambiguous representation of your object, often useful for debugging and development.\n",
        "Convention: The string returned by __repr__ should ideally look like a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object (e.g., ClassName(arg1, arg2)).\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",

        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=>  The super() function is used to access methods of a parent class (superclass) from within a subclass. It returns a proxy object that delegates method calls to the parent or sibling class of the current class.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's the main significance of super():\n",
        "\n",
        "- Calling Parent Class Constructors (__init__): The most common use case for super() is to call the constructor (__init__) of the parent class from within the subclass's __init__ method. This ensures that the parent class's initialization logic is executed, setting up the necessary attributes and state defined in the parent.\n",
        "\n",
        "    \n",
        "-  Calling Overridden Parent Methods: If a subclass overrides a method that is also defined in the parent class, you can use super() to call the parent's version of that method from within the overridden method in the subclass. This is useful when you want to extend or add to the parent's behavior rather than completely replacing it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Working with Multiple Inheritance and MRO: In the context of multiple inheritance, super() becomes even more powerful. It follows the Method Resolution Order (MRO) of the class to determine which parent or sibling class's method to call. This helps in coordinating calls in complex inheritance hierarchies and correctly executing methods in the order defined by the MRO.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the exact behavior in complex multiple inheritance scenarios can be nuanced and depends on the MRO, super() is the standard and recommended way to delegate calls to the next appropriate method in the inheritance chain.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> The significance of the __del__ method lies in its role as a destructor for objects. It's called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of its purpose and significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Cleanup Operations: The primary purpose of __del__ is to perform cleanup operations that are necessary before an object is completely removed from memory.\n",
        "This might include:\n",
        "- Closing file handles or network connections.\n",
        "- Releasing external resources (like database connections).\n",
        "- Deleting temporary files.\n",
        "- Performing any other actions required to free up resources held by the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Object Lifecycle: __del__ is part of an object's lifecycle in Python. Objects are created (typically via __init__) and eventually destroyed. The __del__ method is executed during the destruction phase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important Considerations and Why __del__ is Used Cautiously:\n",
        "\n",
        "While __del__ exists for cleanup, it's important to understand that its use in Python is often discouraged or approached with caution compared to destructors in some other languages (like C++). Here's why:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Unpredictable Timing: The exact timing of when __del__ is called is not guaranteed. Python's garbage collector determines when objects are no longer needed and can be collected. This means you can't rely on __del__ being called immediately after you're finished with an object.\n",
        "- Circular References: __del__ might not be called at all if there are circular references (where two or more objects refer to each other, preventing their reference counts from dropping to zero).\n",
        "- Exceptions in __del__: Exceptions raised within __del__ are ignored by default, which can make debugging difficult.\n",
        "- Resource Management: For most resource management tasks (like files, network connections, etc.), it's generally better to use with statements (context managers) or explicit close() methods. These approaches provide more predictable and reliable ways to release resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "\n",
        "=>\n",

        "- It cannot access or modify class or instance attributes.\n",

        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "\n",
        "=> As we discussed, inheritance allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from a superclass. Polymorphism means \"many forms\" and refers to the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call in their own way.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you combine these two concepts in Python, here's what happens:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Common Interface through Inheritance: Inheritance provides the foundation for polymorphism by creating a hierarchy of classes where subclasses share a common interface defined by the superclass. This common interface includes the methods that the subclasses inherit.\n",
        "- Method Overriding for Varied Behavior: Polymorphism is then achieved through method overriding. Subclasses that inherit from a superclass can provide their own specific implementations for methods that are already defined in the superclass. By having the same method name and signature, the subclasses \"override\" the superclass's implementation.\n",
        "- Dynamic Dispatch: Python uses dynamic dispatch (also known as late binding) to determine which method implementation to call at runtime. When you call a method on an object, Python looks at the actual type of the object (not just the variable type) to decide which version of the method to execute.\n",
        "How it looks in practice:\n",
        "\n",
        "Imagine our Animal example again:\n",

        "\n",
        "=> Method chaining is a programming technique where you call multiple methods on an object in a single expression, with each method call returning the object itself (or another object that can have methods called on it). This creates a sequence of method calls that are executed one after another, often making the code more concise and readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "The basic idea is that each method in the chain performs an operation and then returns the modified object, allowing the next method in the chain to operate on that modified object.\n",

        "\n",
        "=> When you define a __call__ method in a class, you can then call an object of that class as if it were a function. The code inside the __call__ method will be executed when the object is called.\n",

        "- Purpose of __call__:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. reating Callable Objects with State: Unlike regular functions, objects can maintain state through their attributes. By using __call__, you can create callable objects that have persistent data or configuration that influences their behavior when called.\n",
